# Fraud Detection Using Graph Neural Networks

## Introduction

Fraud detection is a critical application in various industries, aiming to identify and prevent illicit activities. Leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fraud detection has gained traction due to their ability to capture complex relationships within data. In this document, we explore the application of GNNs on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. We will also delve into the challenges associated with fraud detection datasets, emphasizing the importance of addressing issues like class imbalance and privacy concerns.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset utilized for this fraud detection task is sourced from Kaggle. The data was collected from 1991-2020 and it provides 24386900 number of records and 15 columns. The dataset contains 24357143 legitimate transactions and 29757 illegitimate transactions. Understanding the dataset's scale is crucial for effective analysis. 


## Challenges in Fraud Detection Datasets

### 1. Imbalance

Fraud detection datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where legitimate transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones. This imbalance can lead to biased models. Strategies such as oversampling the minority class or employing specialized loss functions are crucial for mitigating this challenge.

### 2. Privacy Issues

Datasets containing sensitive information, such as credit card transactions, raise privacy concerns. Anonymization and data masking techniques must be applied to protect user identities while maintaining the dataset's utility for fraud detection research.

### 3. Network Representation

Graph-based fraud detection involves representing transactions as nodes and their relationships as edges. Constructing an effective graph representation that captures relevant patterns and anomalies requires careful consideration of the features and relationships between entities.

## Aim and Tools

The primary aim of this project is to explore the application of GNNs for fraud detection. Key tools and libraries that will be utilized include:

### 1. NetworkX

NetworkX is a Python library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing complex networks. It provides essential functionalities for constructing and manipulating graphs, making it suitable for preprocessing and analysis tasks in fraud detection.

### 2. PyTorch Geometric

PyTorch Geometric is an extension library for PyTorch designed specifically for deep learning on irregular structures such as graphs. It offers powerful tools for building graph neural networks and handling graph-structured data efficiently.

### 3. Deep Graph Library (DGL)

DGL is another library for deep learning on graphs, providing a high-level API for building GNNs. It supports various graph neural network architectures and simplifies the implementation of graph-based models.

## Conclusion

Fraud detection using GNNs is a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of fraud identification systems. Addressing challenges like dataset imbalance and privacy concerns requires thoughtful preprocessing and the application of advanced techniques. The exploration of NetworkX, PyTorch Geometric, and Deep Graph Library will enable a comprehensive understanding of graph-based approaches to fraud detection, paving the way for robust and scalable solutions.
